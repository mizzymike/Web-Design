                The difference between the two video files is not the song, but one is streaming from a local source and the other is streaming through youtube. 
            </p> 
<p>
    I had to use "source src=" for a video file and "src=" for the youtube video. Also rendering them different because embedded videos are not hosted by the user they're linked to the website.
